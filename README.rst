This is a simple portfolio website implemented for http://aniamaslowska.pl - Ania Mas≈Çowska, interior design studio. 
It contains gallery, contact form, about page and admin interface for managaing the portfolio galleries.

The project layout is based http://2scoops.org project template. 
It was my first project using Class-based views so I'm not entirely sure wheather there aren't rookie mistakes in the source code.

I've used bootstrap 3 (http://getbootstrap.com) with minor fixes and tweeks to achieve the responsive design. 
I'm using http://addthis.com plugin for social media sharing and added some open graph meta tags for FB sharing.
